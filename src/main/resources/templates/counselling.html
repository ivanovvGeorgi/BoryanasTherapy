    <h2>Understanding Individual Counselling</h2>
    <p>
      Individual counselling provides a safe and confidential space for you to explore your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with a trained professional. It's an opportunity to gain insight into your challenges, develop coping strategies, and work towards positive change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're struggling with anxiety, depression, relationship issues, grief, or other life challenges, individual counselling can offer support and guidance.
    </p>
    <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
    <p>
      My approach to individual counselling is client-centered and collaborative. I believe in creating a strong therapeutic relationship built on trust, empathy, and understanding. I will work with you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and understand your concerns</li>
      <li>Develop coping mechanisms and strategies</li>
      <li>Enhance self-awareness and personal growth</li>
      <li>Improve your overall well-being</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I use evidence-based techniques tailored to your specific needs and goals. Some of the approaches I draw upon include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</li>
      <li>Mindfulness-Based Therapies</li>
      <li>Solution-Focused Therapy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Taking the First Step</h2>
    <p>
      If you're considering individual counselling, I encourage you to reach out. We can schedule a consultation to discuss your needs and how I can help.
